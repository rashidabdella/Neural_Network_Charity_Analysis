# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis


## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate different models to make our decisions. We will train neural network models and optimize them as well. 


## Results

Our goal in this model was to focus on "Is Successful campaigns. Below all the column names of the Application data frame.

-What columns did you remove?
 I kept most of the column names except Name and EIn and switched them interchangeable.

-What was the highest accuracy you produced?
After three attempts, the highest accuracy achieved by running the models was at 72%. 

-Is it possible to increase optimization in accuracy even further?
Yes, however, I'd probably need to add more neurons and use different types of models other than neural neurons. It also helped that I binned the models to hone in on the accuracy. 

-What were the challenges of running these models?
I ran into many issues regarding neuron layers as well as determining what level to use.

## Summary
Overall, the models had about 72% accuracy. Still below the 75% range however, I believer if the model was binned more the accuracy may increase. In this model, I would ty to use random forest classifier models as well as SVM to hone in on the accuracy. Testing out different models can be key to increasing overall accuracy.
